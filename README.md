## Description
 For every shift, management must decide if they should have one or more waiters/waitresses leave early depending on how busy the restaurant is. If a waiter/waitress is given the okay to leave early, it is known that the waiter/waitress was "cut". Evey night, management needs to not only make the decision if a waiter/waitress needs to get cut, but also in what order someone gets cut. This is where the app shines: waiters/waitresses can call a "cut" in the app if they want to leave early that day. If they decide to call a cut, they will enter a queue for the day. Mangement can now have a list of potential people to cut by viewing the cut queue for the day on the app.
